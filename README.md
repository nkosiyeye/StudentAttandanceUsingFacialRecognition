# Face Recognition System for Student Attendance

This project is a **Face Recognition System** designed to automate student attendance tracking. It leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify students and mark their attendance efficiently.

## Features
- **Face Detection and Recognition**: Uses a pre-trained model to detect and recognize faces.
- **Automated Attendance**: Automatically marks attendance based on recognized faces.
- **Database Integration**: Stores attendance records in a database for easy access and management.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for administrators and users.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, dlib, face_recognition
- **Database**: SQLite/MySQL (or any database used in the project)
- **Framework**: Flask/Django (if applicable)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Face-Recognition-System-for-Student-Attendance.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Face-Recognition-System-for-Student-Attendance
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Set up the database:
    - Run the provided SQL script or configure the database as per the project documentation.

5. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Register students with their images for face recognition.
3. Start the attendance system to detect and mark attendance automatically.
4. View or export attendance records from the database.
